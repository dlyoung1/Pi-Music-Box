# Pi-Music-Box
This program was written for a Raspberry Pi. It uses guizero as the interface and it incorporates the pygame library to play WAV files. It was designed for ridesharing, to enable passengers to choose their style of music without distracting the driver. As an additional bonus users can comment within the app, the comments are then displayed on an LCD screen - serial communication with Arduino.
The audio files are located within directories according to genre type. The naming convention for the audio files that I followed is '## Artist_name: Track_title.wav' (e.g., '01 The Beatles: Yellow Submarine.wav').
