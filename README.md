# Pi-Music-Box
This program was written for a Raspberry Pi 3. It uses guizero as the interface and it incorporates the pygame library to play WAV files. 
The audio files are located within directories according to genre type. The naming convention for the audio files that I followed is '## Artist_name: Track_title.wav' (e.g., '01 The Beatles: Yellow Submarine.wav').
